## What is this?

Welcome to my portfolio! Built with so much style, speed, and sass, even Deadpool would swipe right. If you fork this, you get +10 cool points (redeemable for high fives).

## Features

- ⚡ Speed so fast, you’ll need a seatbelt (and maybe a helmet)
- 🤖 AI/ML projects (no actual chimichangas included, but you can pretend)
- 📱 Mobile-friendly (swipe right, but not for dating... unless you’re into coding)
- 🦄 Neon effects that would make a unicorn jealous and a rainbow cry
- 🕶️ Scroll indicators so obvious, even Deadpool would stop scrolling to admire them. Maximum effort!

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# If it breaks, blame Wolverine
```

## Deploy

Push to main and let Netlify/Vercel do their thing. Or ask Cable. Or just yell at your computer until it works (no promises).

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! If you like it, fork, star, or just say hi. If you don’t, Deadpool will find you. (Just kidding. Or am I?)
